# image-classification-using-keras
using keras ,image classification is performed on  STL-10 data-set. 

I have used pretrained model of vgg16, that model was created to win image net competition. I made few changes on my own hoping to to increase the predction accuracy of the model.  

This repository contains a jupyter notebook, the weights obtained after training my  model, python file to visualzie all the images.
