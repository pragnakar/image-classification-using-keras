# image-classification-using-keras-
using keras ,image classification is performed on  STL-10 data-set. 

I have used pretrained model of vgg16, this model was created to win image net competition. I made few changes on my own hoping to to increase the predction accuracy of the model.  

This repository contain the jupyter notebook and the weights obtained after training my  model.
